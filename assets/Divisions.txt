Founded in 1852 in Benicia, California, Mills is the oldest women’s college in the West and one of the oldest in the nation.

They moved the College to our Oakland home in 1871 and built the second-oldest building on campus—Mills Hall. Today, this California Historical Landmark remains as the architectural and administrative center of the College. It was built in only nine months on the juncture of Lion and Chimes Creeks. As was the custom for women’s colleges of the day, Mills Hall initially housed the entire College with the classrooms, dorms, dining hall, and library all in one building. In the lobby, you can see a marble bust of Cyrus Mill

The longest-serving President of Mills and a single mother, Aurelia Henry Reinhardt led the College through two world wars and the Great Depression. Among her many accomplishments, Aurelia was a delegate at the founding of the United Nations.
